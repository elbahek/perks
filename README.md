# Perks

A simple list of Perks (based on Fallout 2) with filter. [App here](https://elbahek.github.io/perks).


#### TODO:
- [ ] Perk add/edit/delete form (should this trigger pull-request?)
- [ ] Traits page
- [x] I need to somehow distinguish between old original perks and newly added


#### Sources

#### On adding new perks
This app only serves as in-house perk collection for our company. I will probably ignore your perks (well, I will discuss them with my group, but no promises).

For now I can only add perks by directly modifying data.json. If you want your perk submitted, please attach it as a feature request or a pull-request.
Add all the necessary requirements and provide a short but meaningful description.
